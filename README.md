## Using Standards Based grading in a General Chemistry course.

Standards based grading is a method of allowing students to show progress in meeting learning targets without penalizing them for lack of prior knowledge or slower learning than their peers. I used standards based grading in a General Chemistry course at Bunker Hill Community College in Spring 2022. Details of the course can be found in the syllabus. I presented the course outcomes at the IRACDA 2022 conference. See the poster and abstract (below) for details.

Interested in standards based grading or have questions about my implementation? Feel free to start a discussion!  

Much of my syllabus is inspired by the work of Dr. Robert Talbert at Grand Valley State University [https://github.com/RobertTalbert/calculus].

## Abstract
### Students who fail and the professor who let them: Standards based grading and student growth in general chemistry

A typical chemistry course covers a variety of mathematical and conceptual topics and students without a strong science or math background can rapidly fall behind. Standards-based grading, with multiple assessment attempts, is a possible strategy to level the playing field for incoming students. Here, I present the progress and outcomes of students in a chemistry course at the community college level using a standards-based grading scheme. Throughout the semester, students were assessed on a total of 26 learning targets. Each learning target was assessed as either “Met” or “Not Yet” with no partial credit. Students could retake each learning target multiple times until the target was met. Overall, student success depended strongly on their participation in the course. Grades started low, with a high failure rate on the first exam; but slowly improved over time. By using standards-based grading, students without a strong prior background, or with setbacks during the start of the semester, were able to catch up and achieve high scores.
